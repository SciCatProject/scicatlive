# Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook instance is preconfigured with an example notebook that shows the usage of [Pyscicat](https://github.com/scicatproject/pyscicat).

## [Pyscicat Notebook](./config/notebooks/pyscicat.ipynb)
This notebook demonstrates all the major actions Pyscicat is capable of: 
 * logging into SciCat backend
 * dataset creation
 * datablock creation
 * attachment upload

## [.env file](./config/.env)
It contains the environment variables for connecting to the backend service deployed by this project

## [Thumbnail image](./config/notebooks/example_files/thumbnail.png)
An example image that is used for the attachment upload demonstration

## Default configuration
This service is only dependant on the backend service, since it demonstrates communication with the latter through Pyscicat.

The notebooks are mounted to the container from the [config/notebooks](config/notebooks/) directory. The changes to these notebooks should *not* be contributed back to this repository, unless this is intentional. In the case you want to upstream changes to these notebooks, be sure to clear all the results from them.

The [main readme](../../README.md) covers all dependencies of this package.
